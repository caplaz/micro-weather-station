# Example sensor card configuration
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.micro_weather_station_temperature
    name: Temperature
    icon: mdi:thermometer
  - entity: sensor.micro_weather_station_humidity
    name: Humidity
    icon: mdi:water-percent
  - entity: sensor.micro_weather_station_pressure
    name: Pressure
    icon: mdi:gauge
title: Weather Sensors
```

### Step 5: Automation Testing

Create a test automation to verify the integration works:

```yaml
# Test automation
automation:
  - alias: "Test Weather Integration"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: weather.micro_weather_station
    action:
      - service: notify.persistent_notification
        data:
          message: >
            Weather changed to: {{ states('weather.micro_weather_station') }}
            Temperature: {{ state_attr('weather.micro_weather_station', 'temperature') }}°C
          title: "Weather Update"
```

## Entities Created

### Weather Entity

- `weather.micro_weather_station` - Main weather entity with current conditions and forecast

This integration creates only the weather entity to avoid duplicating your existing sensor entities. All weather data is displayed through the main weather entity, which references your configured sensors directly.

## Enhanced Dewpoint Support

The integration now supports direct dewpoint sensors for improved accuracy:

- **Direct Dewpoint**: If you have a dewpoint sensor, it will be used directly for maximum accuracy
- **Calculated Dewpoint**: If no dewpoint sensor is available, it will be calculated from temperature and humidity using the Magnus formula
- **Improved Fog Detection**: Better fog detection using conservative humidity thresholds (>98%) combined with dewpoint analysis and solar radiation data
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Seamlessly falls back to calculated dewpoint when direct sensor unavailable

## Weather Detection Logic

For detailed information about the sophisticated meteorological algorithms used for weather condition detection, see [WEATHER_DETECTION_ALGORITHM](WEATHER_DETECTION_ALGORITHM.md).

## Intelligent Forecasting

The integration provides sophisticated 5-day daily and 24-hour hourly forecasts using meteorological principles and your actual sensor data.

For comprehensive information about the advanced forecasting algorithms, meteorological principles, and technical implementation details, see [WEATHER_FORECAST_ALGORITHM](WEATHER_FORECAST_ALGORITHM.md).

### Key Features

- **Pressure-based Prediction**: Uses barometric pressure trends as primary forecast driver
- **Temperature Forecasting**: Pressure patterns combined with seasonal variations
- **Condition Prediction**: Sophisticated priority system analyzing multiple weather factors
- **Precipitation Analysis**: Multi-factor probability calculation using humidity and pressure
- **Wind Forecasting**: Considers current conditions and atmospheric pressure changes
- **Local Calibration**: Adapts to your specific microclimate patterns over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### Integration Not Found

**Problem**: "Micro Weather Station" doesn't appear when adding integrations.

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Check if files exist
   ls -la /config/custom_components/micro_weather/
   ```
2. **Check Logs**: Settings → System → Logs, search for `micro_weather`
3. **Restart Required**: Restart Home Assistant after installation
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear cache

#### Integration Loading Errors

**Problem**: Integration loads but shows errors in logs.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Python Version**: Requires Python 3.11+
2. **Verify Dependencies**: All sensors should exist in HA
3. **Review Manifest**: Check `custom_components/micro_weather/manifest.json`
4. **File Permissions**: Ensure files are readable by HA user

### Configuration Issues

#### No Sensors Available

**Problem**: Dropdown menus are empty during configuration.

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify Sensor Entities**:
   - Go to Developer Tools → States
   - Search for your temperature sensors
   - Entity IDs must match exactly
2. **Check Sensor Types**:
   ```yaml
   # Valid temperature sensors should have device_class
   sensor.outdoor_temp:
     device_class: temperature
     unit_of_measurement: "°C" # or "°F"
   ```
3. **Sensor States**: Ensure sensors have valid numeric values

#### Weather Conditions Not Updating

**Problem**: Weather entity stuck on one condition.

**Diagnostic Steps**:

1. **Check Sensor Values**:

   ```bash
   # In Developer Tools → States, verify:
   sensor.outdoor_temperature: 22.5  # Valid number
   sensor.humidity: 65              # 0-100 range
   sensor.pressure: 1013.2          # Valid pressure
   ```

2. **Review Detection Logic**:

   - High solar radiation (>400 W/m²) = Sunny
   - Active rain sensor = Rainy
   - Low solar + high humidity = Foggy
   - Default = Cloudy

3. **Check Update Interval**: Verify sensors update within configured interval

#### Rain Detection Issues

**Problem**: Incorrect precipitation or fog detection.

**Common Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Invalid Rain State Values**:

   ```yaml
   # ❌ WRONG - These values don't work with moisture sensors:
   sensor.rain_state: "rain", "drizzle", "precipitation"

   # ✅ CORRECT - Binary moisture sensors only report:
   sensor.rain_state: "wet" or "dry"
   ```

2. **Fog vs Precipitation**:

   - Fog can make moisture sensors read "wet" without actual precipitation
   - The integration automatically distinguishes between fog moisture and rain
   - Check humidity (>95%) and dewpoint spread (<3°F) for fog conditions

3. **Rain Rate Sensitivity**:
   - Very light rain rates (<0.01 in/hr) may not trigger precipitation detection
   - This prevents false alerts from dew or light fog moisture
   - Increase rain gauge sensitivity if needed

### Testing and Validation

#### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Basic Functionality Test**:

   ```yaml
   # Developer Tools → Services
   service: homeassistant.update_entity
   target:
     entity_id: weather.micro_weather_station
   ```

2. **Sensor Response Test**:

   - Manually change a sensor value (if possible)
   - Wait for update interval
   - Check if weather condition changes

3. **Forecast Test**:
   ```python
   # Check forecast data exists
   forecast = state_attr('weather.micro_weather_station', 'forecast')
   # Should return list of forecast periods
   ```

#### Log Analysis

**Enable Debug Logging**:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.micro_weather: debug
```

**Key Log Messages**:

- `Setting up micro_weather` - Integration loading
