# Weather Forecast Algorithm Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the intelligent forecasting algorithms used in the Micro Weather Station integration. The forecasting system provides both daily (5-day) and hourly (24-hour) predictions based on current sensor data and meteorological principles.

## Overview

The forecast system analyzes current weather conditions, pressure trends, and historical patterns to predict future weather states. It uses a combination of meteorological principles and data-driven analysis to provide accurate forecasts.

### Core Components

1. **Daily Forecast**: 5-day predictions with temperature ranges, conditions, precipitation, and wind
2. **Hourly Forecast**: 24-hour detailed predictions with hourly temperature and condition changes
3. **Pressure-Based Prediction**: Uses barometric pressure trends as the primary forecast driver
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Incorporates humidity, wind patterns, and seasonal variations

## Algorithm Architecture

### 1. Daily Forecast Generation

The daily forecast system (`generate_enhanced_forecast`) creates 5-day predictions using multiple meteorological factors:

#### Temperature Forecasting

**Algorithm**: `forecast_temperature_enhanced()`

```python
# Pressure-based temperature prediction
pressure_trend = analyze_pressure_trends()
if pressure_trend == "rising":
    temp_adjustment = +2°C to +5°C  # High pressure = warmer
elif pressure_trend == "falling":
    temp_adjustment = -2°C to -5°C  # Low pressure = cooler
else:
    temp_adjustment = ±1°C  # Stable pressure = minimal change
```

**Factors Considered**:

- **Pressure Trends**: Rising pressure increases temperature, falling pressure decreases it
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Base temperature adjusted for time of year
- **Day/Night Variation**: Temperature range calculation with diurnal cycles
- **Weather Conditions**: Storm systems bring cooler temperatures

#### Condition Forecasting

**Algorithm**: `forecast_condition_enhanced()`

The condition prediction uses a priority-based system:

1. **Storm Detection** (Highest Priority)

   ```python
   if pressure_trend == "falling" and current_pressure < 1010:
       if wind_speed > 15 or humidity > 85:
           return "thunderstorms" or "rainy"
   ```

2. **Precipitation Analysis**

   ```python
   if humidity > 80 and pressure_trend == "falling":
       return "rainy"
   elif humidity > 70 and temperature < 5°C:
       return "snowy"
   ```

3. **Cloud Cover Prediction**
   ```python
   if pressure_trend == "stable" and humidity > 60:
       return "cloudy" or "partly-cloudy"
   elif pressure_trend == "rising":
       return "sunny" or "clear-night"
   ```

#### Precipitation Forecasting

**Algorithm**: `forecast_precipitation_enhanced()`

Precipitation probability is calculated using multiple indicators:

```python
precipitation_probability = base_chance
if pressure_trend == "falling":
    precipitation_probability += 30%
if humidity > 80:
    precipitation_probability += 25%
if storm_conditions:
    precipitation_probability += 40%

# Clamp to 0-100%
precipitation_probability = min(100, max(0, precipitation_probability))
```

**Precipitation Types**:

- **Rain**: Temperature > 2°C and high humidity
- **Snow**: Temperature ≤ 2°C and sufficient moisture
- **Mixed**: Temperature near freezing point

#### Wind Forecasting

**Algorithm**: `forecast_wind_enhanced()`

Wind speed prediction considers:

```python
base_wind_speed = current_wind_speed
if pressure_trend == "falling":
    wind_multiplier = 1.2 to 1.5  # Stronger winds with low pressure
elif pressure_trend == "rising":
    wind_multiplier = 0.8 to 1.0  # Calmer winds with high pressure

forecast_wind = base_wind_speed * wind_multiplier
```

**Wind Direction**: Maintains current wind direction with slight variations based on pressure patterns.

### 2. Hourly Forecast Generation

The hourly forecast system (`generate_hourly_forecast`) provides 24-hour detailed predictions:

#### Temperature Evolution

**Algorithm**: Hourly temperature changes using sinusoidal patterns:

```python
# Base pattern for temperature evolution
hour_offset = (hour - 6) * 15  # Peak at 2-3 PM
temp_variation = sin(hour_offset) * daily_range / 2

# Apply pressure-based adjustments
if pressure_trend == "falling":
    temp_variation -= hour * 0.1  # Gradual cooling
elif pressure_trend == "rising":
    temp_variation += hour * 0.05  # Gradual warming
```

#### Condition Transitions

Hourly conditions follow logical weather progression:

1. **Stable Conditions**: Maintain base condition with minor variations
2. **Transitional Weather**: Gradual changes (sunny → partly-cloudy → cloudy)
3. **Storm Development**: Rapid changes during weather fronts

#### Humidity Forecasting

**Algorithm**: `forecast_humidity_enhanced()`

```python
if condition in ["rainy", "thunderstorms"]:
    humidity = 85-95%
elif condition in ["cloudy", "fog"]:
    humidity = 70-85%
elif condition in ["sunny", "clear-night"]:
    humidity = 40-60%
```

## Meteorological Principles

### Pressure-Based Forecasting

The system heavily relies on barometric pressure trends, which are excellent weather predictors:

#### Pressure Patterns

- **Rising Pressure** (>1013 hPa increasing): Clear skies, stable weather
- **Falling Pressure** (<1010 hPa decreasing): Storms, precipitation likely
- **Stable Pressure** (±1 hPa variation): Continued current conditions

#### Pressure Rate Analysis

```python
def analyze_pressure_trends():
    pressure_change = current_pressure - historical_average
    rate_of_change = pressure_change / time_period

    if rate_of_change > 1.5:  # hPa/hour
        return "rapidly_rising"
    elif rate_of_change > 0.5:
        return "rising"
    elif rate_of_change < -1.5:
        return "rapidly_falling"
    elif rate_of_change < -0.5:
        return "falling"
    else:
        return "stable"
```

### Wind Pattern Analysis

Wind direction and speed changes provide additional forecast insights:

#### Wind Direction Shifts

- **Clockwise Shift**: Usually indicates improving weather
- **Counterclockwise Shift**: Often suggests deteriorating conditions
- **Steady Direction**: Stable weather pattern continuation

#### Wind Speed Patterns

- **Increasing Winds**: Storm approach or pressure gradient strengthening
- **Decreasing Winds**: High pressure building, calmer conditions
- **Gusty Winds**: Turbulent conditions, possible thunderstorms

### Humidity Integration

Relative humidity combines with other factors for accurate predictions:

#### Humidity Thresholds

- **>90%**: Fog, rain, or storm conditions likely
- **70-90%**: Cloudy conditions, possible precipitation
- **50-70%**: Partly cloudy, stable conditions
- **<50%**: Clear skies, dry conditions

## Forecast Accuracy Features

```python
def safe_forecast_generation():
    try:
        # Primary forecast algorithm
        return generate_enhanced_forecast()
    except Exception:
        # Fallback to simplified forecast
        return generate_basic_forecast()
```
