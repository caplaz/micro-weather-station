        Analyzes atmospheric conditions to determine fog likelihood using
        scientific criteria for fog formation. The algorithm considers:

        - Humidity levels (fog requires near-saturation)
        - Temperature-dewpoint spread (closer = higher fog probability)
        - Wind speed (light winds favor fog formation)
        - Solar radiation (low radiation indicates existing fog)
        - Time of day (radiation fog typically forms at night/early morning)
        - Dawn/twilight conditions (prevent false fog detection during sunrise/sunset)

        Fog Types Detected:
        - Dense fog: Extremely high humidity (99%+) with minimal spread AND very low solar radiation
        - Radiation fog: High humidity (98%+) with light winds at night AND no solar radiation
