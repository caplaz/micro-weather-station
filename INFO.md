## Key Components

### Weather Detector (`weather_detector.py`)

- Analyzes real sensor data to detect weather conditions
- Priority-based detection algorithm
- Supports multiple sensor types for comprehensive analysis
- Handles unit conversions and data validation

### Configuration Flow (`config_flow.py`)

- Handles sensor entity selection through Home Assistant UI
- Entity selectors for each sensor type
- Supports options flow for modifying sensor mappings
- Validation for sensor entity existence

### Entities

- Weather entity with intelligent condition detection
- Individual sensors that relay data from configured entities
- Proper device information and unique IDs
- Update coordination through DataUpdateCoordinator

## HACS Requirements Met

- ✅ Proper manifest.json with required fields
- ✅ Integration follows Home Assistant structure
- ✅ Uses config flow for setup
- ✅ Includes proper documentation
- ✅ Has LICENSE file
- ✅ Uses semantic versioning
- ✅ Includes hacs.json configuration
- ✅ Proper translation support

## Testing

The integration can be tested by:

1. Installing in Home Assistant
2. Adding through Integrations page
3. Configuring your existing weather sensors
4. Monitoring weather condition detection accuracy
5. Testing automations with detected weather conditions
6. Validating sensor data processing and unit conversions
